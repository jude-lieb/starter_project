Disc Golf Profile Viewer (pdga.com source)

Note: this project makes use of AI generated code

Description: This react application uses web scraping of the PDGA (Professional Disc Golf Academy) search and profile pages to provide information in a reformatted environment. I chose this project idea because it is difficult to compare my rating with other players because the PDGA website requires you to change pages each time you view or search a player's profile.

### `npm i`, `npm start`
